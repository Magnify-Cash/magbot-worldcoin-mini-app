# Backend Integration Points

## Authentication & Authorization
- World ID verification status tracking
- Wallet authentication
- Session management
- Rate limiting implementation

## Wallet Operations
### Balance Management
- GET /api/wallet/balance
  - Retrieves user's current balance
  - Required for WalletBalance component

### Token Operations
- GET /api/wallet/tokens
  - Fetches list of supported tokens and their balances
  - Used in TokenList component
- POST /api/wallet/buy
  - Handles token purchase operations
  - Called from WalletActions buy function
- POST /api/wallet/send
  - Processes token transfer operations
  - Called from WalletActions send function

## Loan Management
### Loan Operations
- POST /api/loans/apply
  - Processes loan applications
  - Validates against user's verification level
- GET /api/loans/dashboard
  - Retrieves user's loan history and status
- POST /api/loans/repay
  - Handles loan repayment processing

### Verification Status
- GET /api/verification/status
  - Checks user's current verification level
  - Used across multiple components for access control

## Data Storage
### User Profile
- Verification status
- Loan history
- Transaction history
- Wallet balances

### Transaction History
- Loan applications
- Repayments
- Token transfers
- Purchase history

## DevOps Considerations

### Monitoring
- Implement logging for all API endpoints
- Track verification status changes
- Monitor loan application success/failure rates
- Track token transfer success rates

### Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation
- Transaction signing verification
- World ID proof verification

### Performance
- Cache frequently accessed data (balances, verification status)
- Implement database indexing for quick lookups
- Use CDN for static assets

### Deployment
- Use containerization (Docker)
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Set up staging environment
- Automated testing before deployment

### Backup & Recovery
- Regular database backups
- Transaction logs
- Disaster recovery plan

### Scaling
- Horizontal scaling strategy
- Load balancing configuration
- Database sharding strategy
